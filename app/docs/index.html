      <h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
      <p>
        Neither the developer, the goverment nor a hacker can access your
        messages. You do not pass any personal data about yourself into this
        app. All you need is your username and password and you're safe on the
        go.
      </p>
      <p>
        With your login, you can access your messages from anywhere without
        having to download any software. Lithium3 runs completely in the
        browser, and every calculation is done by your device so that no
        encryption key can be catched.

        <br />
        <div>
          <h3>Username</h3>
          <p>
            When a username is entered, it is checked whether it contains
            characters that cannot be written to the database. If this is the
            case, an error message is displayed above the input field, which
            tells the user which character he should remove. Each user name must
            be unique.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Password</h3>
          <p>
            The password is first checked to see if it is eight digits long. If
            this is the case, a request is sent to the API of
            <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned.com</a> whether
            the password is listed there or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            This API offers a list of leaked passwords. Every password in this
            list has to be regarded as insecure, since we have to assume that a
            hacker also has access to these leaked passwords.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this purpose, the first five characters of the SHA-1 hash of
            your chosen password are sent, the server then returns every hash
            startig with the given five characters, which then will be compared
            to the hash of the password entered by the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your chosen password is eight digits long and not in the leaked
            database, it is secure.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Write new account to the database</h3>
          <p>
            A 15000 timed SHA-512 hash is created using a combination of your
            username, password and a random salt. The salt comes from the
            database and is used to safeguard passwords in storage by increasing
            the amount of entropy.

      <div id="keyExchange">

        <h2>Key Exchange</h2>
        <br />
        <div>
          <h3>Diffie-Hellman</h3>
          <p>
            By klicking on "Create new chat" in the Menu, a Diffie-Hellman Key
            Exchange will be initialized. The client calculates public and
            private parameters for the exchange. Then the public parameters are
            passed on as a Base64 encoded JSON-Object to the other user with
            whom you want to start the chat. The transfer takes place via a
            QR-Code or a simple link. The first client then waits for response
            from the second client, by listening to the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the key exchange, the entry is deleted from the database.

        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <br />
        <div>
          <h3>AES-256</h3>
          <p>
            Every chat has a randomly generated password. Both chat participants
            have a copy of this password in their directory on the database.
            This copy is encrypted with the hash of the own user password. We
            use tripled AES-256 encryption.
          </p>

      <div id="feedback">
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Feedback messages</h2>
        <br />
        <div>
          <p>
            The messages that are passed on to the client are intentionally very
            vague. This is to give a possible attacker as little feedback as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This level of information should be enough for the normal user.
